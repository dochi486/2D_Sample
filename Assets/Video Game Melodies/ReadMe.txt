3. Select your desired melody file as the source. 
4. Alternatively - You can drag melody MP3 file from Project Browser on to a GameObject and the sound file will be placed as a Child GameObject. 
5. Mix Volume, Priority, etc. and you are ready to go!

For more detailed information on how to set up an AudioSource - view the Unity tutorials, Manual, and Scripting API at https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/audio/audio-sources-and-listeners?playlist=17096 

 
MP3 FORMAT:
All files are in MP3 format so they can be easily dragged into Unity, then placed into an AudioSource component and they are ready to be used! 
MP3 format allows the melodies to be decent quality without being a large file size, which is great for mobile games.

The names/titles of the melodies are merely suggestions… be creative and place the melodies however you see fit in your game!
